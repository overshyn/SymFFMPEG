arith:
  tests arithmetic encoding and decoding using somewhat random data.
  overly verbose.

arith_encode:
  tests arithmetic encoding by encoding test_file into test_file_arith.out
  Not useful.

arith_decode:
  doesn't compile

arith_fixup_shift:
  Checks the correctness of schro_table_arith_shift[].

arith_speed:
  measures the speed of the arithmetic decoder.  First column is number
  of decode bits tested.  Second is fraction of 1 bits (on a scale of
  0 to 256).  Third is number of cycles to decode N bits averaged over
  10 runs.  Fourth is standard deviation of the mean of the 3rd column.
  Ignore the last.

bits:
  Prints out the bit representation of numbers encoded using
  schro_bits_encode_uint() and schro_bits_encode_sint().

bits2:
  Encodes/decodes arrays of random numbers using schro_bits.

encode:
  encodes a ten frame segment (of solid grey data) for every size from
  64x64 to 79x79.

global_motion:
  checks schro_motion_field_global_prediction(), i.e., calculating
  global motion from an array of motion vectors.

motion:
  measures speed of schro_frame_copy_with_motion(), using all zero
  vectors.

obmc:
  calculates and displays OBMC arrays for a hard-coded obmc size.

phasecorrelation:
  a toy to play with phase correlation for image detection.

predict:
  broken

quant:
  prints out a graph visualising the quantiser dead zone.

struct_offsets:
  a tool to print out struct offsets for the arith assembly code

tables:
  a tool to print out schrotables.c

wavelet:
  tests 1-d wavelet transforms.  I'm not sure if this code is correct.

wavelet_2d:
  tests 2-d wavelet transforms.  This code has been verified in multiple
  ways that it is correct.  (Or very consistently incorrect.)
