0.3.10
======

 - Lots of new classes and implementations were added for Schr√∂dinger.
 - Several i386 implementations also compile on amd64, so these were
   copied over to a separate directory and are now enabled on amd64.
 - Feature detection on amd64 has been fixed.
 - All known startup warnings have been fixed.
 - The core now handles arrays that are 'N plus a constant' in length.
 - Wrap a bunch of functions in HAVE_UNALIGNED_ACCESS to indicate that
   they require an architecture that handles unaligned access.
