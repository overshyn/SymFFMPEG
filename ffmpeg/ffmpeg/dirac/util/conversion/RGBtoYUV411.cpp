/*****************************************************************
File RGBtoYUV411.cpp

Utility for converting a sequence of frames, stored in a single
file in raw RGB format, to a single output file in which they are
stored in YUV411 format.
This utility is a filter taking input on stdin and generating its
output on stdout.
Raw RGB format is simply a sequence of byte triples representing the
red, green and blue components of each pixel.
YUV411 is a planar format which stores the Y component of each frame,
as a sequence of bytes, followed by the U component followed by the V
component. That is the colour component are multiplexed framewise,
rather than pixel wise or in some other way. In YUV411 format the
U and V colour components are subsampled 4:1 horizontally.
