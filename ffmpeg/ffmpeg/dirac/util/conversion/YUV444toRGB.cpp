/*****************************************************************
File YUV444toRGB.cpp

Utility for converting a sequence of frames, stored in a single
file in raw YUV444 format, to a single output file in which they are
stored in RGB format.
This utility is a filter taking input on stdin and generating its
output on stdout.
Input YUV444 format stores the Y component of each frame,
as a sequence of bytes, followed by the U component followed by the V
component. That is the colour component are multiplexed framewise,
rather than pixel wise or in some other way.
The output raw RGB format is simply a sequence of byte triples
representing the red, green and blue components of each pixel.
