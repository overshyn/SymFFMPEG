            next picture in display order. In general these will differ, and
            because of re-ordering there is a delay which needs to be imposed.
            This creates problems at the start and at the end of the sequence
            which must be dealt with. At the start we just keep outputting
            picture 0. At the end you will need to loop for longer to get all
            the pictures out. It's up to the calling function to do something
            with the decoded pictures as they come out -- write them to screen
            or to file, for example.  .
            If coding is fast enough the compressed version could be watched
            real-time (with suitable buffering in the calling function to
            account for encode-time variations).

            NOTE: LoadNextFrame must be called atleast once before invoking this
            method.
